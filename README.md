## Problem Statement: 
* Retail businesses struggle with unpredictable sales patterns, leading to inefficient 
inventory management and lost revenue. 
* Traditional sales forecasting methods fail to account for seasonality, promotions, and 
external factors affecting demand. 
* Lack of accurate demand prediction results in stockouts, overstocking, and suboptimal 
resource allocation. 
* Businesses require an automated, data-driven forecasting system to improve sales 
planning and operational efficiency. 
* Existing forecasting models lack integration with strategic decision-making for 
marketing, staffing, and pricing. 

## Objectives: 
* Demand forecast: To develop predictive models that forecast sales in a dynamic 
environment  
* Finding seasonal patterns: Identifying the periodic variations of the sales-driven economy 
with trend analysis.  
* Location-based business outcome optimisation: Analysing the correlation between 
business outcomes/sales performance with the geographic location for personalised and 
strategic business expansion in optimal regions  
* Suggesting market-based promotions and marketing: Inspecting the effect of marketing 
and promotional activities of the firm on the general public and suggesting improvement 
through data analytics.
